\title{NNS Seasonality Test}
\usage{
NNS.seas(variable, modulo = NULL, mod.only = TRUE, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{a numeric vector.}

\item{modulo}{integer; NULL (default) Used to find the nearest multiple in the reported seasonal period.}

\item{mod.only}{logical; code{TRUE} (default) Limits the number of seasonal periods returned to the specified \code{modulo}.}

\item{plot}{logical; \code{TRUE} (default) Returns the plot of all periods exhibiting seasonality and the variable level reference.}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of all periods exhibiting less coefficient of variation than the variable with \code{"all.periods"}; and the single period exhibiting the least coefficient of variation versus the variable with \code{"best.period"}.  If no seasonality is detected, \code{NNS.seas} will return ("No Seasonality Detected").
}
\description{
Seasonality test based on the coefficient of variation for the variable and lagged component series.  A result of 1 signifies no seasonality present.
}
\examples{
set.seed(123)
x <- rnorm(100)

## To call strongest period based on coefficient of variation:
NNS.seas(x)$best.period
